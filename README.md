# SimpleAnalyticsTypes

This package stores the types that are used as transport types in my SimplaAnalytics project at 
https://github.com/jaywardell/Simple_Analytics.

I'm factoring them out into a separate package so that they can be used by both the server and the client.

The package consists of:

##UserEvent
The type that is passed back and forth to the SimpleAnalytics server
